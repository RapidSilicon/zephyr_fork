  The Rapid Silicon pin controller has one register per pin number. 
  Each register exposes the four modes:

     PIN_FN_MAIN
     PIN_FN_FPGA
     PIN_FN_ALT
     PIN_FN_DEBUG

  It also exposes the bits to enable or disable the pull resistors 
  as well as direction to pull a pin. 
  
  As a result, the following shows an example of a pin 
  configuration for one flow engine peripheral in virgo_tc_eval board.

  #include <dt-bindings/pinctrl/rapidsi_virgo_pinctrl.h>

  /*
    In the following example, each element in pins property is defined as:
    1 - phandle to pinctrl node
    2 - pin number
    3 - pin mode as listed above.
    4 - pin pull resistor enabled or disabled
    5 - pin pull resistor direction being up or down.
  */
  &pinctrl {
    #pin-cells = <4>;
    ofe_default_pinmux {   
      group1 { 
        pins = <&pinctrl 0 PIN_FN_ALT PIN_PULL_STATUS_DIS PIN_PULL_DIR_DOWN>;
        pin-names = "CONFIG_DONE";
      };
      group2 {
        pins = <&pinctrl 1 PIN_FN_ALT PIN_PULL_STATUS_DIS PIN_PULL_DIR_DOWN>;
        pin-names = "CONFIG_ERROR";
      };
    };
  };

  &ofe {
    pinctrl-0 = <&ofe_default_pinmux>;
  };

  In the above example, config_done is assigned pin number 0 with 
  alternate functionality where pull resistors are disabled. In case the
  pull resistors are disabled the PIN_PULL_DIR... argument is ignored.

  In the light of the above example, the ofe node related yaml file will 
  need to include the pins (type:phandle-array) and pin-names (type:string-array) 
  properties. And the correct arguments from 2 to 5 can be extracted 
  using DT_PHA_BY_NAME Macro.
